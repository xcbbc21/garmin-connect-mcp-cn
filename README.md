MCP server for Garmin Connect. Access your activities, health stats, sleep data, FIT files, and more from Claude Code or any MCP client. This fork defaults to Garmin China.

## Why This Exists

In March 2026, Garmin changed their authentication API, breaking [garth](https://github.com/matin/garth) and [python-garminconnect](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect) — the two most popular libraries for accessing Garmin data programmatically. Garth has been [officially deprecated](https://github.com/matin/garth/discussions/222). Garmin added Cloudflare TLS fingerprinting that blocks all non-browser HTTP clients (Node.js `fetch`, Python `requests`, `curl`) from their API endpoints.

This project works around that by routing all API calls through a headless Playwright browser, inheriting a real Chrome TLS fingerprint. Authentication uses browser cookies captured from a manual login session.

## Install from source

```bash
gh repo clone xcbbc21/garmin-connect-mcp-cn
cd garmin-connect-mcp-cn
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build
```

Then register with Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add garmin -- node /absolute/path/to/garmin-connect-mcp-cn/dist/index.js
```

You also need the Playwright MCP server for the login flow:

```bash
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Playwright MCP server (for browser-based login)
- A Garmin Connect account with a synced device

## Setup

### 1. Login

In Claude Code, call the `garmin-login` tool. It will walk you through:

1. Opening Garmin Connect in the Playwright browser
2. Logging in manually
3. Extracting cookies and CSRF token
4. Saving the session to `~/.garmin-connect-mcp/session.json`

The login region is controlled by `GARMIN_REGION` and defaults to `cn`. For
China, the browser opens Garmin's regional SSO page and API requests use
`connect.garmin.cn`. Set `GARMIN_REGION=global` to use the international Garmin
service instead.

### 2. Verify

Call the `check-session` tool to confirm authentication works.

Session cookies expire after a few hours. Re-run the login flow when they do.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code / MCP Client
        |
        | MCP (stdio)
        v
garmin-connect-mcp server
        |
        | page.evaluate(fetch(...))
        v
Headless Playwright Chromium
        |
        | HTTPS (real Chrome TLS fingerprint)
        v
 connect.garmin.cn/gc-api/* (or connect.garmin.com for global)
```

All API calls are made from within a headless Chromium browser context via `page.evaluate(fetch(...))`. This inherits the real Chrome TLS fingerprint, bypassing Cloudflare's detection of non-browser clients.

**Auth flow**: Cookies + CSRF token are captured from a manual browser login (via the Playwright MCP server) and stored at `~/.garmin-connect-mcp/session.json`. The headless browser loads these cookies on startup.

**Why not direct HTTP?** Cloudflare blocks Node.js `fetch`, Python `requests`, and even `curl` with a 403. Only requests from a real browser TLS stack are accepted.

## Development

```bash
gh repo clone xcbbc21/garmin-connect-mcp-cn
cd garmin-connect-mcp-cn
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build
```

### Scripts

| Command             | Description                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build`     | Compile TypeScript                             |
| `npm run lint`      | Run ESLint                                     |
| `npm run format`    | Format with Prettier                           |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type check without emitting                    |
| `npm run test:unit` | Run offline regional URL tests                 |
| `npm test`          | Run integration tests (requires valid session) |

### Local Integration Testing

The standalone test suite (`npm test`) requires a valid Garmin session and hits the real API. Run it locally after authenticating:

```bash
npm test
```

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch off `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Run checks:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run format
   npm run typecheck
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Test via Claude Code**: The recommended way to verify your changes is through Claude Code. After building, call the `run-tests` MCP tool — it returns a test plan that exercises all 27 tools against the live Garmin API. Tell Claude to execute the plan and report results.
5. Open a PR against `main`

CI runs lint, format check, typecheck, and build on every PR. Integration tests run locally only (they require Garmin authentication that can't safely run in CI).

### Releasing

Releases are fully automated. Every merge to `main` triggers the release workflow which:

1. Runs CI (lint, format, typecheck, build)
2. Bumps the patch version
3. Publishes to npm with provenance
4. Creates a GitHub Release

No manual version bumping or tagging needed — just merge your PR.
